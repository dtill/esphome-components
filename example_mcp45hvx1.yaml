    # Attention: There is an issue with i2c Interface on these chips.
    # Please refer to https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/OTH/ProductDocuments/Errata/80000649B.pdf for more details.
    # Workaround: "Each MCP45HVX1 device would need to be on a unique I2C bus with no other I2C devices."
    # device i2c-address default is 0x3c but can be set by address-PIN A0 (5) and A1 (3) to 0x3d, 0x3e and 0x3f
